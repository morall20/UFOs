## Overview of Project:
Dana wanted to create more functionality to her UFO website, So I'm working with her to add more filtering capabilities to search through her data file.

## Results: 
Dana's "The Truth is Out There" website has finally launched with some new updates. The site has four key sections to the webpage.

* Section 1, Serves as the title article placeholder.
* Section 2, is where our user can read our daily news article or exciting UFO's site update.
* Section 3, is where the user can filter through the UFO sighting dataset utilizing a multi-criteria filtering JavaScript.
* Section 4, is where the user will see the results from there customized filtered search.

In the filter section the user can narrow down the dataset search results with the use of the single or multiple criteriaâ€™s filtered JavaScript. The user can choose from one or multiple of our 5 dataset criteria date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary:
I am proud of the website that Dana and I were able to create for our fellow UFO sighters and we are excited to bring our community new features in future development. We at UFO sighting know that our dataset is limited but it is growing daily so do not forget to check back regularly. The site will be expanding by adding new categories like Alien and Ghost sights.
- Currently UFO Sightings is focusing on increasing the logging of our sightings throughout the world. To bring a more robust data set for our user to comb through.
- We are also looking to increase the fields in our datasets to include time of day, photo and video hyperlinks.
